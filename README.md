  Enhance session browsing, skill categorization, and filtering based on user interests or learning styles.  
- Add user feedback and reputation system  
  - Display feedback directly on a user's profile page  
  - Use a star rating system based on received feedback  
  - Help learners choose teachers based on quality and past session experience
